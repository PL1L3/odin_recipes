    <p>Sometimes the best things come in one pot! This <em>baked chicken</em> and rice dish saves you the
        cleanup without skimping on flavor. After you quickly pan fry your <em>seasoned chicken</em>, remove it
        and cook garlic and onions in the leftover juices. Add rice and broth, cook everything, and top
        with the chicken before baking for another 35 minutes (optional: broil the chicken separately to
        get a crispier skin.) You'll be left with a mountain of food so delicious, you'll meal prep this
        super easy recipe at least once a week forever.</p>
